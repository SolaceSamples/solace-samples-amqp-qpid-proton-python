# Getting Started Tutorials

## Using Apache Qpid Proton Python over AMQP 1.0 with Solace Message Routers

The Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) is an open standard application layer protocol for message-oriented middleware, and Solace Message Routers support AMQP 1.0.

In addition to information provided on the Solace [Developer Portal](http://dev.solace.com/tech/amqp/), you may also look at external sources for more details about AMQP:

 - http://www.amqp.org
 - https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=amqp
 - http://docs.oasis-open.org/amqp/core/v1.0/amqp-core-complete-v1.0.pdf

The "Getting Started" tutorials will get you up to speed and sending messages with Solace technology as quickly as possible. There are three ways you can get started:

- Follow [these instructions](https://cloud.solace.com/create-messaging-service/) to quickly spin up a cloud-based Solace messaging service for your applications.
- Follow [these instructions](https://docs.solace.com/Solace-VMR-Set-Up/Setting-Up-VMRs.htm) to start the Solace VMR in leading Clouds, Container Platforms or Hypervisors. The tutorials outline where to download and how to install the Solace VMR.
- If your company has Solace message routers deployed, contact your middleware team to obtain the host name or IP address of a Solace message router to test against, a username and password to access it, and a VPN in which you can produce and consume messages.
